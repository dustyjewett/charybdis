Charybdis
======

A tool for snatching snapshots of urls... specifically, reports.

The unseen monster lurking below, it eats urls and spits out diffs.





Name & Icon
-----------
Scylla is a part of Greek Mythology, originally a beautiful daughter of Poseidon, but turned into a sea monster after
she threatened too much of Zeus's land.

She now creates a whirlpool three times a day, sucking in enormous amounts of seawater, and any ships that happen to be
passing by.  She then spits out the entire contents of what she swallowed, creating even more mayhem.

The icon is appropriated from:
